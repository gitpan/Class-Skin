<comment> this comment will not be shown in the final html </comment>
<comment> the title will be in `title'</comment>
*** $title ***

Here two templates will be included:
<comment> including template with its filepath </comment>
<include src="template2.txt">

<comment> 
 including template that its path is in a variable called filepath </comment>
<include src="$filepath">

Here we will put some conditions:
<if condition="condition1">
 condition1 is true
 <if condition="condition2">
  condition2 is true (in condition1)
 </if>
 <if condition="condition3">
  condition3 is true (in condition1)
  <if condition="condition5">
   condition5 is true (in condition3 that in condition1)
  </if>
  <else>
   condition5 is false (in condition3 that in condition1)
  </else>
 </if>
</if>
<elsif condition="condition2">
 condition2 is true
</elsif>
<if condition="condition4">
 condition4 is true
</if>
<elsif condition="condition5">
 condition5 is true
</elsif>
<elsif condition="condition6">
 condition6 is true
</elsif>
<else>
 condition5,4,6 are false
</else>

Here we will put a table where the rows are in a while loop.
Note that we use $a here, but $a is not defined in the calling script, so
it stays $a. Only in the last loop of the while we will define $a.
<while condition="func">
$i: $a <if condition="condition7"> condition7 is true inside the while loop. </if><else> condition7 is false inside the while loop. </else>
</while>
