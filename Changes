Revision history for Perl extension Class::Skin.

	- Fixed a Segmentation fault. I cannot believe it actually
	  worked without this fix. But it did. The bug was that I forgot
	  to write the "return" statement in root_tnode that is in
	  libskin/skin.y. 
	  Maybe with the older version of gcc it compiles anyway with
	  the return, when it was omitted? Anyway, this is fixed. 
	  For the record, I ran in the past, and ran also today, after
	  the fix valgrind and found no errors but some leaks. I
	  cannot deal with those leaks as long as perl itself suffer
	  from them. Anyway, it looks now stable. But be careful.
